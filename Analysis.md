# Analysis

## Preface

In this analysis, we will try to answer the questions we have had regarding our data by manipulating the data 
to be represented by various parameters and graphs.

## Question: Which metal oxides are present at various temperatures and humidities?

Observations:
- mean Temperature 17.965&deg;C
- mean Relative Humidity 48.775%
- mean Absolute Humidity 0.995 gm<sup>-3</sup>

### Sensor Counts at Various Temperatures

### Sensor Counts at Various Absolute Humidities

### Conclusions

For the Temperature plots, we see that the majority of detections happen just below the mean temperature. 
We also see an increase in Tungsten Oxide detections as the temperature increases, 
and a decrease in Indium Oxide detections as the temperature increases.  

The Relative Humidity plots show us that Tin Oxide and Tungsten Oxide nominally targeted for Nitrous Oxides are detected mostly below the average.
 Tungsten Oxide when nominally targeted for NO2 is found higher than when targeted for Nitrous Oxides.  
 
 The Absolute Humidity plots show an increase in Tungsten Oxide detections as Absolute Humidity increases.
 
 ## Question: Is there an Increase in Titanium Dioxide detections?
 
 Titanium Dioxide is dangerous to Inhale.  
 Observations:

 ### Conclusion
 
 There doesn't appear to be any cause for alarm regarding the increase in Titanium Oxide detections as there is no significant change from 2004 to 2005. Titanium Dioxide is detected mostly from 8:00 - 9:00 and 17:00 - 19:00.
