## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The **US Envoironmental Protection Agency**
The Italian National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Economic Development has provided data on several metal oxides in the air in micrograms per cenimetre cubed (CO, non metanic hydrocarbons, NO, NO2, tungsten oxide, indium oxide). The data also contains the date, and timestamps in hourly increments for when the samples were collected. We will also have access and temperature, absolute humidity, and relative humidity.The data will be analysed from a csv file using the Pandas library for Python. We can use the given concentrarion of metal oxides to obtain a safety level for each compound. The data has enough entries to ensure accuracy based of of the given info. The data is gathered between 2004 and 2005. The purpose of the data is to provide information regarding the potentially harful substances in the area. The data was gathered from 5 metal oxide chemical sensors in an air quality multisensor device. The device was deployed in a polluted area in an italian city.
