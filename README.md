Our topic is air quality over time. Weâ€™re interested in this topic because air quality is very variable with time, but it will be very interesting to compare air quality changes on a short-term scale versus a long-term scale. On a short-term scale it could be used to estimate a best time of day to do physical activity for someone with asthma or for an elderly person to plan what time of day is best to travel to the store. On a long-term scale it could be interesting to compare the change in air quality in Italy versus somewhere like Canada with relatively low air pollution versus somewhere like Hong Kong. This comparison could be used as a first step in comparing reasons for respiratory health and life-expectancy of the people who live there. Another interesting question would be if we found any outliers in the dataset that we could correlate to a particular event that would affect air quality.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The Italian National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Economic Development has provided data on several metal oxides in the air in micrograms per cenimetre cubed (CO, non metanic hydrocarbons, NO, NO2, tungsten oxide, indium oxide). The data also contains the date, and timestamps in hourly increments for when the samples were collected. We will also have access and temperature, absolute humidity, and relative humidity.The data will be analysed from a csv file using the Pandas library for Python. We can use the given concentrarion of metal oxides to obtain a safety level for each compound. The data has enough entries to ensure accuracy based of of the given info. The data is gathered between 2004 and 2005. The purpose of the data is to provide information regarding the potentially harful substances in the area. The data was gathered from 5 metal oxide chemical sensors in an air quality multisensor device. The device was deployed in a polluted area in an italian city.
