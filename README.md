## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The **US Envoironmental Protection Agency** collected data across the United States and its Territories. The data is collected by air monitoring systems at various locations. The data consists of the concentration of various gases and elements (CO,NO2,Cd,Pb,etc) measured in parts per million or nanograms per cubic meter. The data provides the location, and date of the measurement. The data will provide insight as to which states are more polluted than others and will look for corellations to form a hypothesis regarding pollution and state, pollution and month, pollution and year. We hope to grant insight on short term and long term projections of US air quality, and find some fun facts and peculiarities of different states with respect to air quality. The data will be gathered from a BigQuery Table using Python Pandas. As the source data is large, we will be able to provide accurate and percise information.
