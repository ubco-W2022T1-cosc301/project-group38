## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

Our topic is air quality over time. Weâ€™re interested in this topic because air quality is very variable with time, but it will be very interesting to compare air quality changes on a short-term scale versus a long-term scale. On a short-term scale it could be used to estimate a best time of day to do physical activity for someone with asthma or for an elderly person to plan what time of day is best to travel to the store. On a long-term scale it could be interesting to compare the change in air quality in Italy versus somewhere like Canada with relatively low air pollution versus somewhere like Hong Kong. This comparison could be used as a first step in comparing reasons for respiratory health and life-expectancy of the people who live there. Another interesting question would be if we found any outliers in the dataset that we could correlate to a particular event that would affect air quality.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The **US Envoironmental Protection Agency** collected data across the United States and its Territories. The data is collected by air monitoring systems at various locations. The data consists of the concentration of various gases and elements (CO,NO2,Cd,Pb,etc) measured in parts per million or nanograms per cubic meter. The data provides the location, and date of the measurement. The data will provide insight as to which states are more polluted than others and will look for corellations to form a hypothesis regarding pollution and state, pollution and month, pollution and year. We hope to grant insight on short term and long term projections of US air quality, and find some fun facts and peculiarities of different states with respect to air quality. The data will be gathered from a BigQuery Table using Python Pandas. As the source data is large, we will be able to provide accurate and percise information.
