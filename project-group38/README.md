This dataset contains the responses of a gas multisensor device deployed on the field in an Italian city. Hourly responses averages are recorded along with gas concentrations references from a certified analyzer. This dataset was taken from UCI Machine Learning Repository: 

The dataset contains 9357 instances of hourly averaged responses from an array of 5 metal oxide chemical sensors embedded in an Air Quality Chemical Multisensor Device. The device was located on the field in a significantly polluted area, at road level,within an Italian city. Data were recorded from March 2004 to February 2005 (one year) representing the longest freely available recordings of on field deployed air quality chemical sensor devices responses. Ground Truth hourly averaged concentrations for CO, Non Metanic Hydrocarbons, Benzene, Total Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) and were provided by a co-located reference certified analyzer. Evidences of cross-sensitivities as well as both concept and sensor drifts are present as described in De Vito et al., Sens. And Act. B, Vol. 129,2,2008 (citation required) eventually affecting sensors concentration estimation capabilities. Missing values are tagged with -200 value.
This dataset can be used exclusively for research purposes. Commercial purposes are fully excluded.


## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The **US Envoironmental Protection Agency** collected data across the United States and its Territories. The data is collected by air monitoring systems at various locations. The data consists of the concentration of various gases and elements (CO,NO2,Cd,Pb,etc) measured in parts per million or nanograms per cubic meter. The data provides the location, and date of the measurement. The data will provide insight as to which states are more polluted than others and will look for corellations to form a hypothesis regarding pollution and state, pollution and month, pollution and year. We hope to grant insight on short term and long term projections of US air quality, and find some fun facts and peculiarities of different states with respect to air quality. The data will be gathered from a BigQuery Table using Python Pandas. As the source data is large, we will be able to provide accurate and precise information. AQS must maintain constant readiness to accept data and meet high data integrity requirements.
